    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cups of Japanese sushi rice</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons of rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>6 sheets of nori</li>
        <li>8 ounces of smoked salmon, cut into long strips</li>
        <li>one cucumber</li>
        <li>1 avocado</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    
    
    <ol>
        <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</li> 
        <li>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</li>
        <li>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of 
            the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice about
             1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed.</li>
        <li>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 
            equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls. </li>
    </ol>
